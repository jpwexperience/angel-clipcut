# Angel Clip / Cut
Reimplementation of <a href="https://github.com/jpwexperience/clipcut-gui" target="_blank">Clip / Cut</a> using Electron and Angular.

## Getting Stared
1. Clone Repository 
2. install dependencies with 'npm install' while in repository directory
3. run 'npm run angel' in repository directory 

## Things to Note
The functionality for making the clips themselves is running. The style and input validation, specifically for the start time and duration time is still rough.
